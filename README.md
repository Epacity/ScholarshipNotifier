# Scholarship Notifier
A project that synthesizes Twilio and Typeform to notify students about new scholarships.

I created this notification system during high school because I noticed that many students, including myself, would rarely use the previous system. This project makes use of [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) for SMS alerts, [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/) as a user interface, and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) for an API.

To run the scholarship notifier, use the command `python3 api.py`. To change the notifier's configuration, edit `config.py`.
